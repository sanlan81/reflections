How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

You should use command FC and then two files . After run you can see differents between files. You compare two files. 



This is another importent inform how to create folder
cd ~                          # change directories to your home directory
mkdir version-control         # make version-control directory
cd version-control            # go to version-control directory
mkdir reflections             # create reflections directory
cd reflections                # go to reflections directory
subl lesson_1_reflections.txt # launch sublime with file called lesson_1_r




How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

The first that i've found that I can do my work and will do not to change anything because I can forget. Another bad way I don't need to save new inform every hour or every day because I'll not still  finish it.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
